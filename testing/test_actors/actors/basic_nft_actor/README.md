# Basic NFT Actor

This is an **example** that uses the
[frc53_nft](../../../../frc53_nft/README.md) package to implement a
[FRC-0053-compliant](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FRCs/frc-0053.md)
token actor. This actor **should not be used in production** as it has a
faucet-like minting strategy.
