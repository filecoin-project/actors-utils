# Basic Token Actor

This is an **example** that uses the
[frc46_token](../../../../frc46_token/README.md) package to implement a
[FRC-0046-compliant](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FRCs/frc-0046.md)
token actor. This actor **should not be used in production** as it has a
faucet-like minting strategy.
