# Basic Token Actor

This example uses the
[fil_fungible_token](../../../../fil_fungible_token/README.md) package to
implement a
[FRC XXX compliant](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/discussions/407)
token actor.

This actor SHOULD NOT be used in production as it has a faucet-like minting
strategy.
